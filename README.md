#### Backend

I am a backend dev currently working on eactivitypub (an experiment to see how a Mastodon/ActivityPub clone would work in Elixir), but that may change in the near future.
I also do amplifier circuit boards, like the BD139 Thing.

#### Data Work

I also do some data work with OpenCL and Python 3. **Todo**: Add more information for this part.
