### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You found it, the answer to the [ultimate question of my life, possibly the universe, and everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything).

They/Them pronouns. In this README I describe some projects I've contributed and created.

[![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=chlorophytus&layout=compact)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

#### C++: [nbody2024](https://github.com/Chlorophytus/nbody2024)

This is an example of utilizing multithreading to approximate an [N-body simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_simulation).

#### Elixir: [exfwghtblog](https://github.com/Chlorophytus/exfwghtblog)/[exsemantica](https://github.com/ExSemantica/ExSemantica)

ExSemantica is a big side-project to create a link aggregator. Exfwghtblog is a lightweight blog application in Elixir, but not really production ready yet. I'll have to complete both at later dates.

#### Simple PCB design: [RMoy](https://github.com/Chlorophytus/RMoy)

The RMoy is a CMoy-style headphone amplifier using a Burr-Brown OPA2134 dual operational amplifier. I designed this in KiCad. I still have to fix some issues with the design which I will at a later date.
