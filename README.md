#### FPGA

I am a **F**ield **P**rogrammable **G**ate **A**rray hobbyist dev, meaning I can hardware accelerate parallel (or simple) problems up to a few hundred megahertz. In my opinion, the more components that operate at once, the more work can be accomplished per megahertz.

#### Backend

I am a backend dev who is also working on ExSemantica, a featherweight platform for social networking, but that may change in the near future.

#### Miscellaneous

I also do some data/gamedev work with C++, Rust, or Python. **Todo**: Add more information for this part.
