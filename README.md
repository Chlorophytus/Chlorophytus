### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

You found it, the answer to the [ultimate question of my life, possibly the universe, and everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life,_the_Universe,_and_Everything).

He/They pronouns

#### FPGA

I am a **F**ield **P**rogrammable **G**ate **A**rray hobbyist dev, meaning I can hardware accelerate parallel (or simple) problems up to a few hundred megahertz. In my opinion, the more components that operate at once, the more work can be accomplished per megahertz.

#### Backend

I am a backend dev who is also working on ExSemantica, a featherweight platform for social networking, but that may change in the near future.

#### Data Work

I also do some data work with OpenCL and Python 3. **Todo**: Add more information for this part.
